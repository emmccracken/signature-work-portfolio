## Chromesthesia Concert
For my Creative Coding class's final, I used an Arduino, a color sensor, and a speaker to make colors play music. I wired everything together and built a handheld device for people to use to test my project. I utilized skeleton code to calibrate the color sensor and to begin my basis for the musical colors. Instead of the primary Red, Green, and Blue detecting included in the skeleton code, I added Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Magenta thresholds. I then made each color play a musical note from the speaker when detected, in the order of a seven-key piano. I created music sheets for basic songs to play with my color piano for our final exhibition.

## Exploratory Factor Analysis
For my STAT400 Data Mining & Machine Learning class's final, I did exploratory factor analysis on the dataset we chose. For our project, we were split into groups. We had to run multiple data mining techniques, so my group found a large dataset that applied to neural networks, decision trees, and clustering- which we had focused on in that class. We chose a data set regarding airplane passenger satisfaction with testing and training data. We were also allowed to use methods from outside classes, so I decided to use a technique from my STAT360 Comp STAT & Data Analysis class, exploratory factor analysis, because I thought it would be interesting to see what factors affect an airplane passenger's satisfaction. I did this analysis in R, and you can check out my work and my findings here: [Exploratory Factor Analysis (STAT400 Final)](https://github.com/emmccracken/stat-400-final)
