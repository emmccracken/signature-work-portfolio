## Chromesthesia Concert
### Completed in the Arduino IDE
For my Creative Coding class's final, I used an Arduino, a color sensor, and a speaker to make colors play music. I wired everything together and built a handheld device for people to use to test my project. I utilized skeleton code to calibrate the color sensor and to begin my basis for the musical colors. Instead of the primary Red, Green, and Blue detecting included in the skeleton code, I added Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Magenta thresholds. I then made each color play a musical note from the speaker when detected, in the order of a seven-key piano. I created music sheets for basic songs to play with my color piano for our final exhibition. I named this project Chromesthesia Concert as chromesthesia is a specific type of synesthesia where colors truly do make noise.

## Perlin Noise
### Completed in Visual Studio Code with JavaScript and HTML
Also, in my Creative Coding class, we completed an exercise where we were instructed to utilize object-oriented programming and P5.js to create an animation on an HTML site. I used Perlin noise, a type of gradient noise used by computer graphics artists to create a semi-random but still cohesive style of movement or shape. I created particles so the site's visitor can change their number, and these particles move according to Perlin noise and input from the mouse. The particles can also be rotated via a slider input. This website was essentially an exercise in playing around with user input and visual effects and can be run/visited here: [Perlin Noise (Creative Coding Project)](https://github.com/emmccracken/perlin-noise-project)   

## Exploratory Factor Analysis
### Completed in R and R-Studio
For my STAT400 Data Mining & Machine Learning class's final, I did exploratory factor analysis on the dataset we chose. For our project, we were split into groups. We had to run multiple data mining techniques, so my group found a large dataset that applied to neural networks, decision trees, and clustering- which we had focused on in that class. We chose a data set regarding airplane passenger satisfaction with testing and training data. We were also allowed to use methods from outside classes, so I decided to use a technique from my STAT360 Comp STAT & Data Analysis class, exploratory factor analysis, because I thought it would be interesting to see what factors affect an airplane passenger's satisfaction. I did this analysis in R, and you can check out my work and my findings here: [Exploratory Factor Analysis (STAT400 Final)](https://github.com/emmccracken/stat-400-final)
