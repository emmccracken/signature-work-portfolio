## Chromesthesia Concert
For my Creative Coding class's final, I used an Arduino, a color sensor, and a speaker to make colors play music. I wired everything together and built a handheld device for people to use to test my project. I utilized skeleton code to calibrate the color sensor and to begin my basis for the musical colors. Instead of the basic Red, Green, and Blue detecting that was included in the skeleton code, I added thresholds for Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Magenta. I then made each color play a musical note from the speaker when detected, in the order of a seven-key piano. I created music sheets for basic songs to play with my color piano to use at our final exhibition.
